# Railway's private network between replicas of the same service is only routable
# over IPv6 on the railnet0 interface (its IPv4 address on that interface is not
# reachable from sibling replicas). JGroups' TCP transport binds the IPv4 address
# by default on a dual-stack interface, so JOINs between replicas silently time
# out. Resolving and passing the literal IPv6 address scopes the fix to JGroups
# only (see cache-ispn.xml), instead of forcing java.net.preferIPv6Addresses=true
# JVM-wide, which would also break the outbound Postgres connection to Neon.
